Initialize a local Nhost project.

```
nhost init
```

To use an existing Nhost project in Nhost Cloud as a starting point, run `nhost init --remote`. This command should only be used once and only if you want to adopt the [Git-based workflow](/platform/git) using the Nhost Cloud project.

The `nhost init --remote` command does the following:

- Creates a new local Nhost project.
- Pulls the database migrations and Hasura metadata from the Nhost Cloud project.
- Resets the remote Nhost Cloud project's database migrations.
