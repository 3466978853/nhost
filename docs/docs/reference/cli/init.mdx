Initialize a local Nhost project.

```
nhost init
```

If you have an existing Nhost project in Nhost Cloud that you want to use as a starting point for local development and for the [Git-based workflow](/platform/git), run `nhost init --remote`.

The `nhost init --remote` command does the following:

- Creates a new local Nhost project.
- Pulls the database migrations and Hasura metadata from the Nhost Cloud project.
- Resets the remote Nhost Cloud project's database migrations.

:::warning

The `nhost init --remote` command should only be run **once**. Running it multiple times will reset the remote Nhost Cloud project's database migrations which can cause migration conflict issues in your development team.
