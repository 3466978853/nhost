Compute resources are the fundamental units that represent the processing power and memory available to your Nhost projects. The primary compute resources are vCPU and RAM. This documentation outlines the key aspects of compute resources in the context of the Nhost Cloud Platform.


## Shared vs Dedicated Compute

All free and pro projects use shared vCPUs:

- 2vCPUs / 1GiB for free projects
- 2vCPUs / 2GiB for pro projects

This is fine if your apps mostly run at low to medium load, occasionally burst for brief periods of time, and can tolerate drops in performance. It is important to understand that the availability of CPU time is not guaranteed.

### Dedicated Compute

On the other hand, for high production workloads where time is important, or variable performance is not at all tolerable, you should consider configuring your project to use dedicated compute resources. 

By choosing dedicated compute, you can be sure that performance is guaranteed and can match the unique demands of your projects. 

To configure dedicated compute to your projects, all you have to do is navigate to the project's settings, and click on "Compute Resources". There you will be able to choose the total amount of resources you want to dedicate, and spread those resources amongst all services.
