Metrics provide insights into your Nhost projects by integrating a managed Grafana instance tailored to them. This feature is available on the Pro plan and allows you to analyze your project's performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize your application.

Metrics can be found in your project's dashboard.

Using Nhost Metrics allows you to identify bottlenecks in your applications, which you can then fix by leveraging [Compute Resources](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/compute) and [Service Replicas](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/service-replicas) to address these performance issues.
